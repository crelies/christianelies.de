**Update 2019/08/14:** Now available as a [Swift package](https://github.com/crelies/RemoteImage) ðŸš€

I want to implement a [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui) pendant of the UIKit remote image view we created at my current employer. I canâ€™t share the code but believe me that compared to the following SwiftUI implementation our UIKit code is more complex, uses an external framework, and has more lines of code.

## The Goal

Letâ€™s start with a short description of the articleâ€™s goal:

Our goal is to create a view that fetches the image at a given URL, shows a loading view during fetching, caches the image, uses the existing SwiftUI image view, and shows an error view if needed.

With this end in mind, letâ€™s start coding.

## The Implementation

The code mainly consists of three components.

### 1. RemoteImageState

The remote image view can have three different states: error, image, and loading. It should be able to render itself dependent on its current state.

```swift
enum RemoteImageState {
    case error(_ error: Error)
    case image(_ image: UIImage)
    case loading
}
```

### 2. RemoteImageService

We need a service that takes care of fetching and caching the image. In addition to that, it should manage the current state of the related remote image.

**Fetching image**

The HTTP request is done using the standard tools (`URLSession` and `URLRequest`) in combination with a simple data task publisher and a sink subscriber (Combine framework).

**Caching image**

Caching is done with `NSCache`. Simple, right? All remote images in one SwiftUI application should share the same cache, therefore the cache is static. The cache can easily be cleared through its `removeAllObjects()` function.

**State changes**

The service conforms to the `ObservableObject` protocol and propagates the state changes made in the `fetchImage`function through a simple `PassthroughSubject` to every subscriber.

```swift
final class RemoteImageService: ObservableObject {
    private var cancellable: AnyCancellable?
    
    static let cache = NSCache<NSURL, UIImage>()
    
    var state: RemoteImageState = .loading {
        didSet {
            objectWillChange.send()
        }
    }
    
    let objectWillChange = PassthroughSubject<Void, Never>()
    
    func fetchImage(atURL url: URL) {
        cancellable?.cancel()
        
        if let image = RemoteImageService.cache.object(forKey: url as NSURL) {
            state = .image(image)
            return
        }
        
        let urlSession = URLSession.shared
        let urlRequest = URLRequest(url: url)
        
        cancellable = urlSession.dataTaskPublisher(for: urlRequest)
            .map { UIImage(data: $0.data) }
            .receive(on: RunLoop.main)
            .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
                switch completion {
                    case .failure(let failure):
                        self.state = .error(failure)
                    default: ()
                }
            }) { image in
                if let image = image {
                    RemoteImageService.cache.setObject(image, forKey: url as NSURL)
                    self.state = .image(image)
                } else {
                    self.state = .error(RemoteImageServiceError.couldNotCreateImage)
                }
            }
    }
}
```

###  3. RemoteImage

This last component is the view itself. It uses an instance of `RemoteImageService` and renders itself dependent on the state in the service.

The initializer expects a URL and a `ViewBuilder` block for each state (error, image, and loading).

**Fetching image**

As soon as the `LoadingView` appears on the screen, the `fetchImage` function of the `RemoteImageService` instance is triggered.

**Customising image appearance**

Internally the `RemoteImage` view uses the existing Image view of SwiftUI. To be able to customise the appearance of that Image view, itâ€™s exposed through the related `ViewBuilder` block.

**An error occurred**

If an error occurs, the error view `ViewBuilder` is called. The error is passed to the `ViewBuilder` block and can be used to create an error view.

**AnyView**

In this implementation, I had to use the type erased wrapper `AnyView` to erase the different types of views returned in the switch.

Normally the Group view could solve that kind of problem. But the content block of the Group view is a `ViewBuilder`block, and you canâ€™t use the switch statement below (an enum with associated values) in a `ViewBuilder` block.

```swift
struct RemoteImage<ErrorView: View, ImageView: View, LoadingView: View>: View {
    private let url: URL
    private let errorView: (Error) -> ErrorView
    private let imageView: (Image) -> ImageView
    private let loadingView: () -> LoadingView
    @ObservedObject private var service: RemoteImageService = RemoteImageService()
    
    var body: AnyView {
        switch service.state {
            case .error(let error):
                return AnyView(
                    errorView(error)
                )
            case .image(let image):
                return AnyView(
                    self.imageView(Image(uiImage: image))
                )
            case .loading:
                return AnyView(
                    loadingView()
                    .onAppear {
                        self.service.fetchImage(atURL: self.url)
                    }
                )
        }
    }
    
    init(url: URL, @ViewBuilder errorView: @escaping (Error) -> ErrorView, @ViewBuilder imageView: @escaping (Image) -> ImageView, @ViewBuilder loadingView: @escaping () -> LoadingView) {
        self.url = url
        self.errorView = errorView
        self.imageView = imageView
        self.loadingView = loadingView
    }
}
```

## Example

Last but not least, we take a look at a usage example.

The created Remote Image view is easy to use. Just pass a URL, your error view, your image, and your loading view to the initializer.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    private let url = URL(string: "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1524419986249-348e8fa6ad4a?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1950&q=80")!
    
    var body: some View {
        RemoteImage(url: url, errorView: { error in
            Text(error.localizedDescription)
        }, imageView: { image in
            image
            .resizable()
            .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fit)
        }, loadingView: {
            Text("Loading ...")
        })
    }
}
```

Take a look at how I customised the appearance of the Image: I made it resizable and changed the content mode to fit.
