# Corona ğŸ˜· - Link collection

I'm very concerned about the actions taken by the **German government**. I do care a lot about the **German constitution**. It was developed and activated after the collapse of **Nazi Germany**.

Over the last few weeks the constitutional rights have been severely limited. Every time this happens **we have to** take a closer look at what's happening.

> As a *Software engineer* I love **data-driven** *approaches*. In my opinion the **actions taken by a government should be data-driven** as well. In this case **scientifically approved data** should *drive the actions taken by the government*.

*Currently I'm not really convinced* that this is happening because many experts (as an example see the list below) criticize the actions taken by the governments worldwide.

> **Don't get me wrong: I want to protect those who can't protect themselves and I want to be a part of the solution.**

I started to research about ***Corona*** in my free time. One partial result is the below list of scientists and researchers. There are so many scientists and researchers out there which **do care a lot about other people**, **correctness**, **scientific standards**, **data-driven approaches** and much more. I'm well aware that the *mass media and their followers* **degrade these scientists and researchers as conspiracy theorists**.

> But I highly encourage you to form your own opinion by researching and thinking yourself ğŸš€
